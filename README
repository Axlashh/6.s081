xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".

总算是把lab1写完了

这么久没学别的公开课，发现英语又有点小吃力了，文档有时理解不全意思，导致lab做不太顺

lab1还是一些比较基础的实验，主要是熟悉用的

几个bug:

- file descriptor同时开启的数量有上限，使用完记得关

- find的make grade不会检查你是否写了查询具体文件的代码，但是后面的xargs要用，没写的话就有bug

- 大部分实验都可以偷懒，不过感觉还是不太好，我就尽量照着他说的来
